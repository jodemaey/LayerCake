General Information
===================

LayerCake is framework to design models based on systems of partial differential equations (PDEs),
and convert them to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) via Galerkin-type expansions.

LayerCake allows you to construct systems of PDEs, and to specify coordinate systems and basis functions to build the
corresponding ODE systems.
To build these systems, LayerCake relies heavily on |Sympy| symbolic computation framework.
The output of this procedure is either a `Numbaified <https://numba.pydata.org/>`_ Python callable,
or a list of symbolic ODE tendencies that can be integrated in any of the supported languages (Fortran, Julia and Python for the moment).
These two kind of output allow for the study of the computed models with the modern tools available in all these languages.

LayerCake has been designed with geophysics in mind, although it may be useful for other applications.

Installation
------------

With pip
~~~~~~~~

Not yet available.

With Anaconda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The second-easiest way to install and run LayerCake is to use an appropriate environment
created through `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/)>`_.

First install Anaconda and clone the repository: ::

    git clone https://github.com/jodemaey/LayerCake.git

Then install and activate the Python3 Anaconda environment: ::

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate layercake

You can then perform a test by running the script ::

    python examples/atmospheric/barotropic_one_layer.py

to see if everything runs smoothly (this should take less than 5 minutes to run).

Documentation
-------------

To build the documentation, please run (with the conda environment activated): ::

    cd documentation
    make html


You may need to install `make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`_ if it is not already present on your system.
Once built, the documentation is available `here <../index.html>`_.

Examples
--------

A few examples are available in the `examples <../../../../examples>`_ folder. More examples will be provided as the code is
developed.

Forthcoming development
-----------------------

LayerCake is in alpha development phase, with many new functionalities planned over the next few months.
Stay tuned !
